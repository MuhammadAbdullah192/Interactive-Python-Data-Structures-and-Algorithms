This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of various fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. It includes the following data structures: Singly Linked List, Circular Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, and Binary Tree. Additionally, it features implementations of common sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.


Features
Singly Linked List

Insertion: Insert at the start or the end of the list.

Deletion: Delete from the start or the end of the list.

Display: Print all elements in the list.

Circular Linked List

Insertion: Insert at the start or the end of the list.

Deletion: Delete from the start or the end of the list.

Display: Print all elements in the circular list.

Stack

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack.

Peek: View the top element without removing it.

Display: Print all elements in the stack.

Queue

Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.

Dequeue: Remove and return the front element from the queue.

Peek: View the front element without removing it.

Display: Print all elements in the queue.

Graph

Add Vertex: Add a new vertex to the graph.

Add Edge: Add a weighted edge between two vertices.

Display: Print all vertices and their connected edges.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Find the shortest path from a given start vertex to all other vertices.

Binary Tree

Insertion: Insert an element into the binary tree.

Traversal: Perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of the tree.

Sorting

Bubble Sort: Sort a list of numbers using bubble sort.

Insertion Sort: Sort a list of numbers using insertion sort.

Usage
Run the script and interact with the main menu to choose the data structure or algorithm you want to work with. Each data structure and algorithm has a submenu with specific operations you can perform.
